## Description üìñ

### About

This is a simple Blockchain based application with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum **Goerli** Test Network. The smart contract allows users to post any message with their name on the **Goerli** network and also retrieve all posts.

**NOTE**: _Only posts of a particular (your) address can be retrieved_
